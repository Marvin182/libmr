Hi there,

this is my personal C++ library. It's not more than a bunch of more or less useful C++ methods - so far very low level stuff. In future I might add data structures and algorithms.

Build
-----
TODO
(it should be as simple as loading the Qt project)

Usage
-----
TODO
(build, add include directory to project and link to the created binary files)

Headers
-------
TODO
- mr/common - better asserts, wrapped methods for std random header
- mr/timer - Timer class
- mr/Version - Version class (also see gitversion.pri)

License
-------

For know I will stick with the MIT License, but when I have time I will choose or switch to an similar license with a "non-military use only" clause. This code should not be used for any kind of violence.
